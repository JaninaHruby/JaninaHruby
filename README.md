# Hi, I'm Janina 👋✨

> *Data Analyst in progress · Python Enthusiast · Chaotic Good Learner*

I'm currently doing a full-time training as a **Data Analyst & Python Developer** — and yes, I am somehow enrolled in 6+ Coursera courses at the same time. No regrets. (Okay, maybe a little.) I have a passion for finding unconventional solutions to everyday problems, and an unhealthy love for learning everything at once.

---

## 🚀 What I'm up to

- 📊 **Full-time training** in Data Analysis & Python Development
- 🐘 Setting up a **PostgreSQL server** for my own data project *(coming soon to GitHub!)*
- 🤖 Building a **Coursera tracker web app** — because if you have too many courses, clearly the solution is to build another project *(first draft is live!)*
  - Next step: adding an **AI agent** that writes learning plans and keeps me motivated 
- 🧪 Vibe-coding my way through projects and *then* asking Claude to explain what happened
